# Task-Manager-App

## ðŸ“˜ Reflection

Building this task manager app was an interesting but sometimes tricky project. One of the biggest challenges was making sure tasks updated correctly, especially when the status changed or when filtering by category. Getting the overdue logic to work based on the current date also took a bit of trial and error, since I had to compare dates properly and make sure everything refreshed at the right time.

To solve those problems, I broke things down into smaller steps: first getting tasks to display, then adding filtering, and finally handling localStorage so tasks wouldnâ€™t disappear on refresh. Once that was working, I focused on styling the app to make it look clean and easy to use.

If I had more time, Iâ€™d love to add editing for existing tasks, maybe drag-and-drop capabilities, and even some sort of notification for upcoming or overdue deadlines. Overall, it was a great learning experience and a solid way to practice real-world JavaScript and DOM manipulation.
